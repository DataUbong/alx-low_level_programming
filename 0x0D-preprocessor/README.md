 - Preprocessor

The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tool and it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing before the actual compilation. We'll refer to the C Preprocessor as CPP.



All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#). It must be the first nonblank character, and for readability, a preprocessor directive should begin in the first column. The following section lists down all the important preprocessor directives

#define
Substitutes a preprocessor macro.

2	
#include
Inserts a particular header from another file.

3	
#undef
Undefines a preprocessor macro.

4	
#ifdef
Returns true if this macro is defined.

5	
#ifndef
Returns true if this macro is not defined.

6	
#if
Tests if a compile time condition is true.

7	
#else
The alternative for #if.

8	
#elif
#else and #if in one statement.

9	
#endif
Ends preprocessor conditional.

10	
#error
Prints error message on stderr.

11	
#pragma
Issues special commands to the compiler, using a standardized method
